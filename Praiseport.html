    <strong> Favorite Quotes </strong>
    <br> "Serving others for the Glory of God-Pursuit of true Greatness"
    <br>
    <br> “As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a  pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we  wish to dominate our lives.”- Henry David Thoreau
